As I continue on my coffee quest, I think it only seems fair to try coffee related food. I had a chocolate, coffee, and chipotle old fashioned donut at [Nomad Donuts](http://nomaddonuts.com/) in North Park. Lucky for me, but maybe not for the intention of the donut, I couldn't really taste any coffee. Turns out, when you add coffee to chocolate baked goods, it just enhances the chocolate flavor. I decided not to have any coffee with with my donut, but opted instead for OJ knowing that I was to have coffee later in the day. Now that I think about it, maybe I missed out on a quintisential coffee and donut experience. Maybe next time.

As I did with beer, I'm starting out with what I have been told is *"good coffee"*. My first beer was a [Karl Strauss Red Trolley](http://www.karlstrauss.com/beer/redtrolley.html) I had while out with co-workers. They were shocked I hadn't had the true San Diego college experience of playing beer-pong with quarter full cups of Bud Lite. I think I lucked out on that one...Nevertheless, my experience with beer has been privileged. Living in the craft beer capital of America, I couldn't have picked a better place to start my beer education. San Diego may not have the *best* coffee roasters and coffee shops, but it seems like they are popping up everywhere. Could coffee be the next beer? I think it's too soon to tell.

Simone and I were looking for a place to have coffee and get some blogging done so we settled on [Heartwork Coffee Bar](http://heartworkcoffeebar.com/) in Mission Hills. Wanting to try something new, I had a cappuccino to see how it compared to a latte. Unfortunately, we got to Heartwork just as they were closing, so my cappuccino ended up in a to-go cup that was enjoyed on our way to our next destination. Unlike it's more milky counterpart the latte, I could really taste the coffee. My first sip was met with mild aversion as the bitter coffee flavors filled my mouth. As I continued to drink, it got better and I finished it without issue. If I had to choose, I would definitely pick a latte over a cappuccino at this point, but I feel like that leads me down a dangerous path. What's next, a Starbucks Frappuccino?! ***Gasp*** Given that I just started drinking coffee, I don't want to be a coffee elitest, but it seems like if you're ordering something like a frappuccino, you probably don't really like coffee, but just sugary coffee flavored milk.

Do I like coffee, or coffee flavored milk?

Remember how I said my cappuccino was enjoyed on the way to our next destination? One would think I would have stopped after the iffy experience I had with the cappuccino, but Simone and I were off to another coffee shop. As I write this, I'm having my first cup of pour-over coffee at [James Coffee Co.](http://jamescoffeeco.com/) in Little Italy. I'm having a cup of Kenya Nguvu coffee, which the little chalk board on the coffee bar describes as "Cane sugar, peach, floral, complex acidity, and a rich body". The acidity really jumps out at me so it's like I'm drinking battery acid. Well, maybe it's not quite that bad, but I'm really missing my cappuccino right about now. It's not very enjoyable, but I'm powering through it. Simone's coffee is a bit less acidic and she assures me that not all coffee is that acidic. Maybe acidity is to coffee as bitterness is to beer? When I started out drinking beer, I couldn't handle bitter IPAs, but now, the more bitter the better. It was a plesant experience watching the barista make the pour-over coffee as it seems like quite the ceremony. I finally finished the coffee as it reached lukewarm, which didn't help the flavor. I don't think this was a very good first experience with pour-over coffee and has put me off drinking straight coffee for at least a little while. For now, I think I'll stick to mixing a little milk with my coffee.
