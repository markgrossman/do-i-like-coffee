Since posting last, I've had three coffee drinks and would have to say, I enjoyed them all. Weird right? I've stuck to my word and have had lattes or latte like drinks. First off, the wonderful Champ from Dark Horse. I mean, how could you go wrong with milk, honey, cinnamon, and espresso. Unlike the previous few times I had a Champ, this time I got it hot. It was light, creamy, and delicious. For the first time, I actually sat at Dark Horse with Simone's cousin Aaron and enjoyed my Champ while he had an Ethiopian harar pour over. I tasted Aaron's pour over and let's just say I stuck to my Champ. If I take anything away from this experience, it would be the knowledge of the Dark Horse Champ, nectar of the gods. 

Next was an iced latte from [Latte by the Sea](http://www.yelp.com/biz/latte-by-the-sea-san-diego) which is located right outside of my building at work. I believe they use [Cafe Moto](http://cafemoto.com/) coffee beans and this was probably my first latte where I didn't dump in the sugar to make it palatable. About 20 minutes after finishing the latte, I felt jittery and a bit paranoid. Sometimes I don't really like how I feel after drinking coffee. Something about feeling excessively alert like a startled cat is not a feeling I particularly enjoy. Maybe that's why I've been only having coffee every other day. I don't want to be dependent on coffee to stay awake or get work done. I want to enjoy coffee for it's taste, not its side benefits.

Today, I ventured to [Holsem Coffee](http://www.holsemcoffee.com/) in North Park.  

*Disclaimer: My lovely wife works at Holsem.*  

From the Eames chairs to the granite counter tops, Holsem screams classy. I had a cold brew creation called the 'Gingersnap' which is made with cold brew, fresh muddled ginger, nutmeg, maple syrup, cream, and shaken in a cocktail shaker. It was quite refreshing and delicious. Something about the foamy top from what I imagine was the shaking and the spiciness from the ginger made the drink something special. As we know from last time, I don't really like cold brew, but the Gingersnap had enough other stuff thrown in that I didn't mind it. I ran into Sorin, a co-worker of mine, who was having a drip coffee. Maybe next time I'll level up to drinking drip coffee...well maybe half coffee and half milk. That's what people mean when they say I'll have the half and half right?

Could I be coming around on this whole coffee thing? I think yes, at least when it's mixed with a bunch of milk. I should try drip/pour-over coffee with some milk and sugar in it next time.
