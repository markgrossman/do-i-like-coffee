I woke up this morning with every intention of having a latte at Dark Horse, but a parking spot right in front of The North Parker apartments was open. I just *had* to park there. I couldn't stick to the plan. I'm such an idiot. I walked in to [Influx Cafe](http://www.influxcafe.com/) planning to get something simple like a latte, but the barista looked so smug and I couldn't let him sense my fear, so I calmly ordered a 16 oz cold brew. *I showed him*. Frequent readers will know that I had every intention of sticking to putting milk in my coffee, but something came over me. Maybe I was groggy from being woken up at 4:30 in the morning. Maybe I got confused between iced coffee and cold brew. Maybe I felt like I had something to prove. 

When I'm thirsty, I want something cold. Even when it's 40 degrees outside, I want that ice cold Coke in a glass bottle that goes down oh so smooth. My cold brew didn't start off well when I couldn't insert the straw due to the iceberg that was pushing up directly underneath the straw insertion zone and as much as I shook the cup, couldn't get the straw in. Finally, I managed to bend the straw around the ice and take my first sip. I didn't like it, but maybe the more I drink, the better it will be.

My commute to work in the morning ranges between 30 to 40 minutes, more than enough time to drink 16 ozs of liquid. This is how much I drank in that time:

I wanted to like it. I'm sure it was made perfectly. I couldn't handle it. It ended up in the trash. Today I had my worst experience with coffee so far and it was all my fault. I was too stubborn to just order what I knew I should have. At this rate, maybe I'll just eat raw coffee beans tomorrow. Baby steps Mark, baby steps.
